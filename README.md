# Web-Crawler
Web Crawler built using Python. Scans all the links on the website and stores them in a text file.

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Run the script main.py with arg1 as the url and arg2 as the directory name. Example: 
   python main.py "http://www.excitel.com" excitel
   
   A text file named 'crawled' will be created inside the directory (e.g 'excitel' here) which will list all the links on the      website.
